% This example file shows how a thesis can be laid out using Latex. It
% does not use any special local features so should be portable to other
% places.
% 
% When producing draft copies of a thesis you may want to print only
% selected pages of the thesis. To do this use the command
% 
% dvips -f -p 4 -n 3 myfile.dvi | lpr
% 
% where -p 4 means start printing at page 4 (ie the page that will be
% numbered 4, not necessarily the 4th page) and -n 3 means print 3 pages.
% This example will print pages 4, 5 and 6.
% 
% If you want to print the thesis and also save paper you can print more
% than one page on each sheet of paper. Use the command
% 
% dvips -f myfile.dvi | psnup -2 | lpr
% 
% to print 2 pages per sheet. psnup can take values 2, 4, 8, or 9.
%
% To produce a PDF version you can create a PostScript copy first
%
% dvips -f myfile.dvi > myfile.pdf
%
% and then convert it
%
% distill myfile.ps
%
% or you can go straight to PDF
%
% pdflatex myfile
%
% Note that pdflatex expects all included figures to be in PDF too. See
% the includegraphics command below.


% This document contains many cross-references and forward references,
% eg in constructing a table of contents, so Latex may need to be run
% twice to get all the references correct. If you need to run Latex twice
% you may get the warning:
% 
% LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-refSerences right.

\begin{abstract}
Scientific computing unravel the mysteries of science by constructing mathematical models and numerical algorithms. This required massive computational power and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solutions like cluster and grid have been the answer to these needs for a long time. These HPC solutions are hard and expensive to setup, maintain and use. \emph{Cloud computing} is a model of delivering the existing compute infrastructure where computation and storage can be dynamically provisioned on a pay as you go model. Using a vendor cloud service like Amazon Web Service (AWS) can significantly reduce the effort to access these on-demand high performance resources.

In this work we create a platform to study how useful Amazon EC2 cloud computing can be for scientific applications. 
We classify the applications based on the concept of computational \emph{motif}\cite{asanovic2008parallel}

\subsection{Spectral Methods}
In scientific computing, a class of techniques used to numerically solve differential equations involving the use of Fast Fouries Transform are called spectral methods

Fourier transform
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) first employed what we now call Fourier transforms whilst working on the theory of heat 
Linear transform which takes temporal or spatial information and converts into information which lies in the frequency domain
Who would use Fourier Transforms? 
• Physics 
– Cosmology (P3M N-body solvers) 
– Fluid mechanics 
– Quantum physics 
– Signal and image processing 
– Antenna studies 
– Optics 

• Numerical analysis 
– Linear systems analysis 
– Boundary value problems 
– Large integer multiplication (Prime finding) 

• Statistics 
– Random process modelling 
– Probability theory

{\underline Discrete Fourier Transform}
The discrete Fourier transform of N complex points fk is defined as
